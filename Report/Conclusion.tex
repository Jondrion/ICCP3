It can be concluded that the lattice boltzmann method used for simulating the flow of an incompressible fluid works properly. Even after introducing moving objects into the flow, the algorithm performs quite well. Improvements can be made to further stabilise the fluid-object interaction and also different pipe geometries can be studied. It would be nice to also look at the behaviour of multiple objects and introduce an object-object interaction.
